libmpegts TODO list

Most important TODO is to get streams verified with a good analyzer
Add Blu-ray formats - dealing with vbr audio?
Is the use of double precision for the PCR within its tolerance?
Is there a need to implement full T-STD modelling or use the simpler version currently implemented?
A true VBR mode? How to implement?
Write ATSC PSIP
Write DVB Tables (SIT, NIT, EIT) etc
Sort out T-STD on SMPTE packets
Add more formats
