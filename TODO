libmpegts TODO list

Most important TODO is to get streams verified with a good analyzer
Figure out why underflows occur unless the muxrate is approx 5-10% higher than the stream bitrates. This is a slightly too high.
Is there a need to implement full T-STD modelling or use the simpler version currently implemented?
A true VBR mode? How to implement?
Write ATSC PSIP
Write DVB Tables (SIT, NIT, EIT) etc
Sort out T-STD on Data streams
Add more formats
Add Blu-ray formats - dealing with vbr audio?
